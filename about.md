## What is Pan?

Pan is a node of the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse 'Fediverse on Wikipedia'), an ensemble independent servers/communities/nodes that communicate among each others.

<h2 id='story'>A brief story</h2>

[Tommi], the founder and administrator of this instance, has been a long time Fediverse enthusiastic user.

During [*Scambi Festival* 2022](https://scambi.org 'Scambi Festival’s official website'), he invited the Italian collective <em lang='it'><a href='https://eticadigitale.org' target='_blank' hreflang='it' title='Etica Digitale official website'>Etica Digitale</a></em> to host [a Lab](https://scambi.org/en/2022/lab/6 'Fediverse: Social Network Umani — Lab Page — Scambi Festival') about it, and for the occasion we deployed [a temporary, experimental Mastodon server](https://web.archive.org/web/20221122103733/https://social.scambi.org/about/more 'About social.scambi.org').

In November 2022 we decided to step up the game, and found a more stable and meaningful instance. [We named it *Pan*](#name). This instance is born out of the necessity of creating a cozy, friendly, young, enthusiastic and tight community of people who believe in [the same values](#values) and have [some things in common](#who).

<h3 id='name'>Why this name?</h3>

Scambi Festival’s staff invented [*Paneurethic*](https://scambi.org/paneurethic 'The Paneurethic Universe of Scambi'), a neologism synthesizing the essence of our purposes and our values. In a hurry to decide how to name our community, our fabulous [Lea](https://pan.rent/@memoriedalsoprassuolo 'Lea’s profile on Pan') suggested *Pan*, from the ancient Greek <q>Πάν</q> (Everything). This terms reflects the chaotic vortex of our collective action, while sharing the root of our neologism.

But how does the `pan.rent` domain name comes into play?  
While scrolling through all the possibile domain names, [Tommi] stumbled upon this TLD, and he could not avoid thinking about his favorite musical ever, the 1996 [*Rent*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent_(musical)), by [Jonathan Larson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Larson). In particular, this passage seems tailored for us:

> We're not gonna pay  
> Last year's rent  
> This year's rent  
> Next year's rent  
> Rent rent rent rent rent  
> We're not gonna pay rent  
> 'Cause **everything is rent**

In conclusion, our name wonderfully labels the identity of a group of people and organizations that fight for a better future, <q>for being an “us” for once, instead of a “them”</q>. We are swirling in a messy messed up *pan*, dominated by the toxic, destructive ethos of Capitalism and egoism.

<h2 id='values'>Our values</h2>

In short, we stand everything that entails a better, sustainable and fair future, and we fight for anything against it.

Practically, this means that Pan:

- stands strongly against Capitalism as an economic model and a mentality
- believes in the right of gender auto-determination and condemns any kind of gender discrimination
- strongly favors of any empowerment of [the Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights 'Universal Declaration of Human Rights — United Nations')
- supports and shares any effort carried out in a choral perspective, and without exploiting anyone
- sympathizes with under-represented peaceful minorities

<h2 id='who'>Who are we?</h2>

Anyone who has a profile on Pan <u>must</u> share some fundamental characteristics:

- **being under-30**. We do not discriminate older people and we do not think to be better, but we want to foster debates, dialogue, and sense of belonging among individuals that share the struggles as well as the privileges of belonging to the same generation.
- **understanding English**. On this instance, we write, chat, speak, and shout in any language. Still, there needs to be some common ground for dialoguing and understanding each other when it is time to have discussions regarding us all.

<h3 id='orgs'>Institutions and organizations</h3>

Among us, there are not only people, but also associations, institutions, organization and entities. Naturally, no age restriction applies to them, but at the same time we demand a close adherence to [our philosophy](#values).

<h3 id='join'>Want to join?</h3>

You might have noticed that public subscriptions are closed. This is not because we want to be exclusive, but rather the opposite! We would love to welcome anyone who is interested, but we really want to make sure that you are sure you are convinced to be part of *this* community, and not of *any* community.

## Why the Glitch fork of Mastodon?

Pan runs on [Mastodon Glitch Edition](https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs 'glitch-soc documentation') because it is full of interesting and crazy features, even if it is a bit crazier and unstable: it perfectly reflects this instance’s [philosophy](#values).
